# GameObject-ObjectComponent
A demonstration of a GameObject and ObjectComponent entity system for game development in C++.

The application is more for demonstration of how one can setup an entity-component system in C++.
It's fairly minimal code and idealy should be split up into several different files. If you are to use this code I would recommend re-implementing it to fit your game as this is meant to demonstrate a basic entity-component system.

# Compiling
The original was compiled in Visual Studio Community 2017. Removal of #include "stdafx.h" will be required to compile most likely.
As for code changes I am sure there is non to very small changes that may need to be done to compile using other compilers.
